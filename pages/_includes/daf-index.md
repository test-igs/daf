Data Access Framework [DAF](http://wiki.siframework.org/Data+Access+Framework+Homepage) is an U.S initiative sponsored by the Office of the National Coordinator [ONC](http://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc) . DAF has multiple implementation guides, each one addressing a different set of use cases and requirements. These implementation guides are described below

1. [DAF-Core](daf-core.html): The DAF-Core IG defines the conformance requirements which includes resources, profiles, value sets and operations necessary for accessing data for a single patient. These requirements have been developed based on the [Argonaut](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) pilot implementations. Implementations of the DAF-Core IG will be completely compliant with the Argonaut program. The DAF-Core IG is being balloted with an STU status.

2. [DAF-Research](daf-research.html): The DAF-Research IG defines the conformance requirements for capabilities used by researchers to access data about multiple patients. These requirements have been developed based on the [PCORnet](http://www.pcornet.org/) use cases and implementations. The DAF-Research IG is being balloted as "For Comments only ballot".
