### DiagnosticReport

When lab test or lab panel, such as CBC, is ordered, a DiagnosticReport represents the order fulfillment and references each of the resulting discrete Observations within that panel.

#### Each DiagnosticReport must have:

-   a patient
-   a code (preferably a LOINC code) which tells you what is being measured
    -   note: additional codes that translate or map to these are allowed - e.g. system specific codes
-   at least one result (an Observation reference)
-   a status
-   a category code of 'LAB'
    -   note: additional category codes that translate or map to these are allowed - e.g. more specific category codes such as “CH” (chemistry)
-   a time indicating when the measurement was taken
-   a time indicating when the measurement was reported
-   who issues the report
