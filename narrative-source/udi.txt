-----------------------

The following data-elements in the Device resource are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present). These are presented below in simple human-readable explanation and a more thorough summary of the requirements. Sample data is provided to demonstrate the requirements.

**Each Device resource must have:**

1.  a patient

<!-- -->

1.  a UDI string (“udicarrier”)
1.  a code identifying the type of resource

#### Complete Summary of the Mandatory Requirements

1.  One patient reference in **Device.patient**
1.  One udicarrier string in **Device.udi**
    -   The Human Readable Form (HRF) representation of the barcode string as printed on the packaging of the device **SHALL** be used. The AIDC representation cannot be conveyed in FHIR, Because of limitations on character sets in XML and the need to round-trip JSON data through XML.

1.  A code in **Device.type**
    -   Device.type with an extensible binding to SNOMED CT [Device Types]
