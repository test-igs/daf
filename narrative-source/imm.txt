Mandatory Data Elements
-----------------------

The following data-elements are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present). These are presented below in simple human-readable explanations along with sample data to demonstrate the requirements.

**Each Immunization must have:**

1.  a status
1.  a date the vaccine was administered
1.  a vaccine code that identifies the kind of vaccine administered
1.  a patient
1.  a flag to indicate whether vaccine was given
1.  a flag to indicate whether the vaccine was reported by patient rather than directly administered.

**Formal Summary of the Mandatory Requirements**

1.  One status in **Immunization.status** which is bound to the **[Argonaut Immunization Status Valueset]**

<!-- -->

1.  One dateTime in **Immunization.date**
1.  One vaccine code in **Immunization.vaccineCode** which is bound to the **[CVX code set]**
1.  One patient in **Immunization.patient**
1.  One boolean value in **Immunization.wasNotGiven**
1.  One boolean value in **Immunization.reported**

Additional elements from [DAF Immunization Profile] may be present.

**NDC codes as a translational data element**

Based upon the 2015 Edition Certification Requirements, the [NDC vaccine codes] SHOULD be supported as [translations] to the CVX vaccine codes. A [NDC to CVX concept map] is provided and the translation is illustrated in the example below.
