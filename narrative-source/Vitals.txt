Mandatory Data Elements
-----------------------

The following data-elements in the Observation resource are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present). These are presented below in simple human-readable explanation and a more thorough summary of the requirements. The table below identifies the minimum set of vital sign concepts and the required codes and units used for representing vitals signs. See that section for additional guidance and examples for each vital sign.

Each Observation must have:

-   a patient
-   a time indicating when the measurement was taken
-   a LOINC code which tells you what is being measured and is taken from the “LOINC Code” column in the table below.
    -   note: If a more specific code is recorded, the generic code and the translated coded must be sent - e.g. method specific LOINC Codes, SNOMED CT concepts, system specific codes
-   a numeric result value and standard UCUM unit which is taken from the “LOINC Code” column in the table below.
    -   note: if there is no numeric result then you have to supply a reason
-   a status
-   a category code of 'vital-signs'

### Vital Signs Table

This table represents a minimum set of vital sign concepts, the required LOINC codes ([Argonaut Vital Signs]), and UCUM units of measure codes ([Argonaut Vital Signs Units]) used for representing vitals signs observations. These are [extensible bindings] defined for this IG and require that when a system support of any of these vital signs concepts, they must represent them using these codes. In addition, if you have a blood pressure observation, you must have both a systolic and a diastolic component, though one or both may have dataAbsentReason instead of a value.

Alternate codes may be provided in addition to the standard LOINC and UCUM codes defined here. An example of [using multiple codes] is provided. Other profiles may make rules about which vital sign must be present or must be present as part of a panel.

### Complete Summary of the Mandatory Requirements

1.  One status in **Observation.status**
1.  One category in **Observation.category** which must have:
    -   a fixed **Observation.category.coding.system=“<http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-category>”**
    -   a fixed **Observation.category.coding.code=“vital-signs”**

1.  A code in **Observation.code**
    -   a fixed **Observation.code.coding.system**=“http://loinc.org”
    -   a LOINC code in **Observation.code.coding.code** which must be taken from the extensible [Argonaut Vital Signs] valueset

1.  Either one **Observation.valueQuantity** or, if there is no value, one code in **Observation.DataAbsentReason** (Note: See the comments in the table for exceptions)
    -   Each Observation.valueQuantity must have:
        -   One numeric value in **Observation.valueQuantity.value**
        -   a fixed '''Observation.valueQuantity.system="<http://unitsofm>
