## Observation

Each Observation represents an individual laboratory test and result value, a “nested” panel (such as a microbial susceptibility panel) which references other observations, or rarely a laboratory test with component result values.

#### Each Observation must have:

-   a patient
-   a LOINC code, if available, which tells you what is being measured
    -   note: additional codes that translate or map to these are allowed - e.g. system specific codes
-   a result value and if the result value is a numeric quantity, a standard UCUM unit
    -   note: if there is no result then you have to supply a reason unless Observation is being used to group a panel then there is no value. Instead, it just includes composite values or related links
-   a status
-   a category code of 'laboratory'
    -   note: additional category codes that translate or map to these are allowed - e.g. more specific category codes such as "chemistry', SNOMED CT concepts, system specific codes

Each Observation should have:

-   a time indicating when the measurement was taken
-   a reference range if available

##### Complete Summary of the Mandatory Requirements

1.  One status in **Observation.status**
1.  One category in **Observation.category** which must have:
    -   a fixed **Observation.category.coding.system=“<http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-category>”**
    -   a fixed **Observation.category.coding.code=“laboratory”**

1.  One code in **Observation.code** which must have if available:
    -   a fixed **Observation.code.coding.system=“<http://loinc.org>”**
    -   a LOINC code in **Observation.code.coding.code**
    -   Other additional codes are allowed - e.g. system specific codes. All codes SHALL have an system value

1.  Either one **Observation.value\[x\]** or one code in **Observation.DataAbsentReason** (unless the Observation.code is a panel code)
    -   Each Observation.valueQuantity must have:
        -   One numeric value in **Observation.valueQuantity.value**
        -   a fixed **Observation.valueQuantity.system=“<http://unitsofmeasure.org>”**
        -   a UCUM unit code in **Observation.valueQuantity.code** taken from the “Units” column in the table
    -   Each Observation.valueCodeableConcept must have either:
        1.  a code in **Observation.valueCodeableConcept.coding.code** and code system in **Observation.valueCodeableConcept.coding.sytem**
            -   [SNOMED CT] is preferred binding

        1.  OR text in **Observation.valueCodeableConcept.text**
    -   Observation.DataAbsentReason is bound to [Observation Value Absent Reason] Value set

1.  One patient in **Observation.subject**

Each Observation should have:

1.  A date and time in **effectiveDateTime** or **effectivePeriod**
1.  A reference range if applicable in **Observation.referenceRange**
